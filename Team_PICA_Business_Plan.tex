\begin{abstract}
%The proposed business plan follows the development a power-monitoring system capable of monitoring total and circuit-by-circuit power usage for a given installation. Such a system would use non-invasive load monitoring techniques to monitor the flow of current through the feeder lines; the system can then aggregate all of this data, and perform data analysis to determine kilowatt hours used, reactive power, line frequency, and in some cases power factor. The system then can display this data to a user in real-time over a wall-mounted display unit or a web interface.

%The following report outlines the design of this system and the major decisions that the design team made. The major accomplishments thus far have been: Meeting with Consumer's Energy, Product competition research, defining a budget and per-system cost estimates, selecting features for inclusion, establishing rough requirements, investigating design possibilities, selecting a metering device for prototyping, and identifying unforeseen constraints. The remaining work for this project includes: solid-state breaker and monitor/controller design and implementation, base station design and implementation, E-meter design and implementation, component and system testing, and prototype construction.

%The final result of the project will be a working prototype which demonstrates the ability to correctly and accurately monitor power consumption. The project is scheduled to be completed by May 7, 2011.

This business plan describes the formation and operation of PICA, LLC., a company formed around the products designed by Team PICA as a senior design project at Calvin College. The company proposes to design, produce, and distribute power-monitoring equipment that may replace typical components of modern electrical building infrastructure. In particular, PICA, LLC.\ will produce a smart power meter for power companies to install on their customers' buildings and with which much more information regarding power quality can be measured, ``smart'' solid-state circuit breakers that improve user safety and deliver information about how much power each circuit in the building uses, and a base station to collect, archive, and display these measurements in real time. Armed with this much information, power consumers will be able to make wiser decisions regarding their power usage.

The market for ``smarter'' electronics and power monitoring continues to grow, and smart meters are already entering deployment on houses in select parts of the country. PICA, LLC.\ intends to produce devices that gather more information and collect and display it in a user-friendly style. The design team believes that these products are completely possible to make and distribute, and can be designed using the knowledge of electrical engineering and systems gained from Calvin's engineering program.

The team estimates first-year costs close to \$300 million, financed 60-40 from debt and equity. This means that about \$120 million will come from investors. The estimated payout time will be 5 years, by which time production and distribution means will be established and enacted.
