\section{Location and Layout}
\subsection{Initial Location and Layout}
To start, the company will have one location -- a 6,000 square foot store located conveniently close to the downtown area of Grand Rapids, Michigan. It includes a development area, service department, offices, and a showroom area.  

\subsection{Geographic Expansion}
Today, many products that are manufactured in one state could be used in other states as well; however, it is always helpful to have a closer location to the customers to offer better support, so successfully choosing the location is very important. Once the Grand Rapids location grows, the company will expand to other parts of Michigan along with a few major cities all around the United States. The first city the company looks to expand to is Chicago, given its close proximity to the headquarters in Michigan. After proven growth in Chicago, the company would expand to other big cities in the west and south, including Los Angeles, CA or Dallas, TX.
